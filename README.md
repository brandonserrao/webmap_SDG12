Domestic Material Consumption (DMS) by countries

The project is created in terms of WebMapping Course. Our webpage focuses on a spatio-temporal analysis of SDG 12 e.g. production/consumption ratios of different countries w.r.t to specific category such as domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP. A time element is added to show change in these values over the years.
